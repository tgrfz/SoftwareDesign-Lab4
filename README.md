# Task 4. Yet another suicide

1. Create RSS reader application (see Flipboard for reference).
2. On first launch app asks user to type in RSS feed URL. This can be changed later.
3. RSS entities are displayed within list view. EAch entity should contain date, title, preview of content and an image (if provided by feed source).
4. When user taps on list item, a WebView with full entity should be displayed.
5. 10 recently fetched news should be cached and available to user even if no network is available.
6. App should track and display network state (icon, snackbar, etc). User should be aware when app goes offline and online.
7. All network operations should not block user interface and should have loading indicator if necessary.

**Topics to cover:** images, network, storage.
